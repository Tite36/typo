Hi :)

Thanks for hepling me. It would litteraly mean the world if you could just take a look at the code and give me your opinion.

Bassicaly my end goal is to make an adaptative font that would change size depending on the volume at wich the user is speaking into the microphone. 
So I have to main parts to my project : the speech recognition and the amplitude analysis.

For the speech recognition i found a script from MDN that recognizes a few colors from a micro input and then changes the page background to the color spoken.
  All the files regarding this issue can be found under the 'color_changer' folder : ( -html -javascript  -css)
   
  
For the amplitude analysis i imported a script from The Coding Train that analyses mic amplitude using p5.sound. I don't know if you're familiar with p5.js but bassically it's a javascript library that to facilitate coding visuals or sound effects.
  The files about the amplitude analysis can be found in the 'micLevel' folder : ( -html  -css -javascript -p5 libraries that are required for the script to run)
    
  
You can also find files with 'iistart' in the name. Those are because I needed a local server to host the web applications. I downloaded windows iis server and modified the start page code so that it would open the color_changer or the micLevel html.

Those files are supposed to allow for the js commands to be executed. 
It works fine with the color_changer script but for the micLevel, I keep getting "not allowed to load local resource" errors.


I really have no idea how to fix this.
I hope you might have a clue.

Thank you so much for taking the time to help me out !!! <3333
